The Product may include certain files, libraries and/or source code specifically designated as "redistributables" by Beyond Ordinary Software Solutions in the accompanying printed or on-line documentation and that are necessary to use Works created using the Product ("Redistributables"). From time to time, Beyond Ordinary Software Solutions may designate other files as Redistributables. You should refer to the documentation, including any "readme" or "deploy" files provided with the Product, for additional information regarding Redistributables. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you may freely redistribute source code or compiled code that is entirely your own and does not contain any Redistributables.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License including the restrictions of Section 3.3, Beyond Ordinary Software Solutions grants you the personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable and limited license to: (a) make exact copies of the Redistributables and distribute those copies solely as components of your Works and solely as required for permitting end users of the Works ("End Users") to install and execute the Works; (b) install and execute Redistributables, without modification, on computers that you own or possess solely for your own internal use; and (c) sublicense to your End Users the personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to install and execute Redistributables, without modification, solely as components of Works and solely for such End Users’ own internal use, subject to End Users’ compliance with the restrictions in Section 5 as to Redistributables. The rights granted to you under this Section 3.2 may not be exercised by others, including co-developers, regardless of how you might compile, link, or package your Works. These rights apply only to Redistributables and to no other file, library, source code or other component or derivative work of the Product. They may be exercised only with respect to Works created by you using a duly licensed, properly registered copy of the Product. 

3.3 Certain Restrictions. Regardless of any modifications that you make and regardless of how you might compile, link, or package your Works: (a) you may not permit your End Users to modify or further distribute Redistributables or use Redistributables in any program that they create; (b) you may not use Beyond Ordinary Software Solutions's or any of its suppliers' names, logos, or trademarks to market your Works, except to state descriptively that your Work was written using the Product; (c) you may not incorporate or distribute a Redistributable with a Work or other program that is capable of functioning as a general purpose development tool, library, or component, or is otherwise generally competitive with or a substitute for the Product or the Redistributable itself; (d) all copies of the Works you create must bear a valid copyright notice, either your own or the Beyond Ordinary Software Solutions copyright notice that appears on the Product, and you may not remove or alter any Beyond Ordinary Software Solutions copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notice contained in any portion of the Redistributables; and (e) you may only distribute Redistributables with Works that add primary and substantial functionality to the Redistributables and are not merely a set or subset of any of the Redistributables, and that are created in accordance with the terms of this License. 

3.4 Relationship with End Users. Except as set forth in Section 4, there are no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement. Consequently, Beyond Ordinary Software Solutions provides no warranty at all to any person, other than the limited warranty provided to you the original purchaser of the Product, as set forth herein, and you will be solely responsible to your End Users (or anyone else who uses or acquires Works) for support, service, upgrades, or technical or other assistance (including with respect to any Redistributables included therein), and such persons will have no right to contact Beyond Ordinary Software Solutions for any services or assistance. You will indemnify, defend and hold Beyond Ordinary Software Solutions, its licensors, its suppliers and each of their respective employees, officers, directors and affiliates, harmless from and against any claims or liabilities arising out of or related to the use, procurement, reproduction or distribution of your Works by third parties. 

3.5 Third Party Software. The Product, including Redistributables, may include source code, redistributable files, and/or other files provided by a third party vendor ("Third Party Product"). Since use of Third Party Product might be subject to license restrictions imposed by the third party vendor, you should refer to the on-line documentation (if any) provided with Third Party Product for any license restrictions imposed by the third party vendor. In any event, any license restrictions imposed by a third party vendor are in addition to, not in lieu of, the terms and conditions of this License. 

3.6 Other Rights. Contact Beyond Ordinary Software Solutions for the applicable royalties due and other licensing terms for all other uses or distribution of the Redistributables.
